Problem:  You want to have something like

[code]
u = User.first
u.courses
=> [ "Yatting", "Fencing", "Drag Racing", "Properly Taught Statistics", "Ruby Reloaded!" ]
[/code]

Well, how do you do that?  Let's create an example app!


Solution:

1)  Create the models and things
2)  Fill in the associations on the model scripts and maybe some basic data
3)  


1)  Create the models and things

[code]
$  rails new model_collection_test
$  cd model_collection_test

$  rails generate scaffold user
$  rails generate model course content:string user_id:integer
$  rails generate model users_courses 
[/code]



2)  Fill in the associations on the model scripts

(app/models/course.rb)
[code]
class Course < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  attr_accessor :courses
  
  def all
    return @courses
  end
end
[/code]

(app/models/user.rb)
[code]
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :courses
end
[/code]

(app/models/users_courses.rb)
[code]
class UsersCourses < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :course
end
[/code]
